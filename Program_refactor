1. Make the lines after "if ((oppo_car_pos[0] > 0) and (oppo_car_pos[0] < region_size[0])
                and (oppo_car_pos[1] > 0) and (oppo_car_pos[1] < region_size[1])):"
    as a decision_making() function

2. All the model (mdp_sys, mpd_env, prod_mdp, etc.) should be initialized before simulation loop. In contrast, in the 
simulaiotn loop, the model should only .update() instead of being built again.

3. The initial prod_state might need to be defined according to the initial system state (and safety/ cs initial states),
use a function to get the initial prod_state
