action: [speed, -steering_angle]
info: custom

1. Init things to know at the beginning
 - ego_state: the car init location and heading
 - ego_prod_state: (sys_state, env_state, spec_state)?
 - static_label: target goal, traffic light, etc.
 
2. Things to modify
 - abs_state_env
 - mpd_env: no traffic light in my scenario
 - safe_frag/scltl_frag: LTL specifications
 - static_label
 - cost_func: safety cost of different things


3. Potential improvements
 - the variable abs_state_sys (grid location of the car) is not stored in the Abstraction
 
 
state_set: [[0, 0], [0, 1], ..., [3, 3]]
state_index_set: np.arange(len(self.state_set)): 0, 1, ...
